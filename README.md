## Plan, path and helpful links to get start and exploring the world of programming. The aim of this repository to help anyone who wants learn code and build things. We will be covering all most all possible paths from beginner to building own artificial intelligence models.

### Computer Science Fundamentals

### Introduction to Programming

- Programming fundamentals

1. Variables

- Variables are used to store values temporarily and life time will be program execution duration

```Python
  country = 'India'
  indian_states = 28;

```

2. Data Types

```Python
  numbers
  strings
  boolean(True, False)
  object
```

3. Operators

- Will be listing most important and commonly used operators

```Python
Assignment Operators ( = )


Comparison Operators ( ==, >, <, >=, <= )

Arithmetic Operators ( +, -, *, /, % )

Logical Operators (python - and , or), (JavaScript - &&, ||)

For rest, please refer dedicated python repository

```

4. Branching/Conditional statements

- if
- while
- switch (Python will not support it)

5. Iterative statements

- for

6. functions

- functions are self contained to perform a particular related task.

  ```Python

    def sayHello:
      print('Hello World')
      return "Hello World"

    sayHello()
  ```

  ```JavaScript
    function sayHello(){
      console.log("Hello World")
      return "Hello World"
    }

    sayHello();

  ```

7. Array/List

- Array are used create and store more than one value and it will be stored in contagious memory location

```Python
  asian_countries = ['India', 'Singapore', 'Thailand', 'Bangkok', 'South Korea', 'Japan']

```

```JavaScript
  We will use pre defined key words to create variables, there are 3 different keywords and it differs among them on scope of variable

  var asian_countries = ['India', 'Singapore', 'Thailand', 'Bangkok', 'South Korea', 'Japan']

```
