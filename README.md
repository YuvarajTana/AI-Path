## Programming - Python or R(We choose Python)

- Here we will be learning programming with Python and will be building couple of products.
- Below is the list of items and there will be dedicated respositories for programming fundamentals and projects

- ### Programming fundamentals

  1. Data types
  2. Arithmetic Expressions
  3. Branching(Conditional) statements(if, if else, switch)
  4. Iterative statements(for, for with range, while)
  5. Strings & Functions
  6. Array/List

- ### Python programming
  1. How to work with above fundamentals in python
  2. Deep dive into list
  3. Dictionary
  4. Classes
  5. others

## Introduction Web (It is Optional)

1. HTML, CSS
2. JavaScript
3. React

## Data Source - SQL, Mysql, MongoDB

SQL - stands for structured language - MySQl - Postgres - Oracle

NoSQl - - MongoDB - Cassandra
